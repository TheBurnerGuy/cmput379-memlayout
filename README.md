## Cmput379-Memlayout

memlayout.c contains two functions, get_mem_layout which scans the entire memory of calling process and returns a list of different regions in the address space, and get_mem_diff which scans the calling process's address space and returns a list of the differences between the regions in the address space and the regions contained in a passed array. The project contains three driver programs, mem_mod[1-3], which illustrate changes made to the address space of the progam.
